=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is mostly a work-a-like for
L<< C<CPAN::Latest::ReleaseHistory::Release>|CPAN::Latest::ReleaseHistory::Release >>, except without the dependency on
L<< C<MetaCPAN::Client>|MetaCPAN::Client >>

  my $release = $releaseiterator->next_release;

  print $release->distname();                   # Dist-Zilla
  print $release->path();                       # R/RJ/RJBS/Dist-Zilla-1.000.tar.gz
  print scalar gmtime $release->timestamp();    # Timestamp is Unixtime.
  print $release->size();                       # 30470 ( bytes )
  my $distinfo = $release->distinfo();          # CPAN::DistInfo object

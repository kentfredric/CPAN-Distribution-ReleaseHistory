=head1 NAME

CPAN::Distribution::ReleaseHistory - Show the release history of a single distribution

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001000

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is similar in concept to C<CPAN::ReleaseHistory>, except its tailored to use a single distribution name, and uses C<MetaCPAN> to resolve its information.

  use CPAN::Distribution::ReleaseHistory;

  my $release_history = CPAN::Distribution::ReleaseHistory->new(
    distribution => 'Dist-Zilla',
    # ua          => a HTTP::Tiny instance to use for requests
    # es          => a Search::Elasticsearch instance
    # scroll_size => 1000  : How many results to fetch per HTTP request
    # sort        => 'desc': Direction of sort ( vs 'asc' and undef )
  );

  # Returns a CPAN::Distribution::ReleaseHistory::ReleaseIterator
  my $iterator = $release_history->release_iterator();

  # $release is an instance of CPAN::Releases::Latest::Release
  while ( my $release = $iterator->next_release() ) {
    print $release->distname();                   # Dist-Zilla
    print $release->path();                       # R/RJ/RJBS/Dist-Zilla-1.000.tar.gz
    print scalar gmtime $release->timestamp();    # Timestamp is Unixtime.
    print $release->size();                       # 30470 ( bytes )
    my $distinfo = $release->distinfo();          # CPAN::DistInfo object
  }

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<release_iterator>

Perform the query and return a new L<< C<CPAN::Distribution::ReleaseHistory::ReleaseIterator>|CPAN::Distribution::ReleaseHistory::ReleaseIterator >> to walk over the results.

  my $iterator = $object->release_iterator

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<ua>

A C<HTTP::Tiny> compatible user agent.

=head2 C<es>

A Search::Elasticsearch instance.

=head2 C<scroll_size>

Volume of results to fetch per request.

  default: 1000

Larger values give slower responses but faster total execution time.

Smaller values give faster responses but slower total execution time. ( Due to paying ping time both ways per request in addition to other per-request overheads that are constant sized )

=head2 C<distribution>

A string exactly matching a name of a CPAN distribution.

example:

  Dist-Zilla
  MetaCPAN-Client
  Search-Elasticsearch
  WWW-Mechanize-Cached

=head2 C<sort>

The implicit sort direction of the output.

  default: 'desc' # The most recent release is returned first.

Alternative options:

  'asc' # The oldest release is returned first
  undef # Results are unsorted

=head4 C<undef>

Opting for C<undef> for this value will give a slight speed up to the responsiveness of queries.

Though this benefit will only be observed in conjunction with low values of C<scroll_size>

  scroll_size > N_results : undef slower than 'desc'
  scroll_size ~ 10        : undef faster than 'desc'
  scroll_size ~ 20        : undef marginally faster than 'desc'
